## Problem Statement

COVID-19 has accelerated the transition from visiting physical stores to online shopping. Predicting customer behavior in the context of e-commerce is steadily gaining importance. It can increase customer satisfaction and sales, resulting in  higher conversion rates and a competitive advantage, by facilitating a more personalized shopping process.

## Research
Cirqueira, Douglas, et al. "Customer Purchase Behavior Prediction in E-commerce: Current Tasks, Applications and Methodologies." *International Workshop New Frontiers in Mining Complex Patterns.* 2019 has very clearly looked at 65 prior research works done in the fields of customer behaviour prediction and jotted down the results in a tabular manner for convenient comparison across parameters such as *supervised/unsupervised algorithms, business intelligence applications and accuracy*.
